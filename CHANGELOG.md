#### 2.3.0
* New method of creating hash indexes added: Sorting
  By presorting the hash entries, the hash table construction can be done using less memory than the size of the hash table.
  The cost is extra CPU time and temporary disk usage.
  As a result, some new API methods have been added:
  - SparkeyWriter.setHashSeed() to manually set which seed to use, for deterministic hash indexes. (Default: random)
  - Add SparkeyWriter.setMaxMemory() to set how much memory to use for index construction (Default: free memory / 2)
  - Add SparkeyWriter.setConstructionMethod to allow for explicit configuration of creation method to use (Default: AUTO)
* Various minor optimizations
* Add dependency on com.fasterxml.util:java-merge-sort

* Performance differences:
  - Writing hash index is 2-3x slower when using sorting (but this can be avoided by setting a large max memory or explicitly
    setting construction method to IN_MEMORY.
  - Random lookups are 6% faster than in 2.2.1 for compressed data and 5-17% faster for uncompressed (more improvement for larger data sets)
